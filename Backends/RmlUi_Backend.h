    This interface serves as a basic abstraction over the various backends included with RmlUi. It is mainly intended as an example to get something
    simple up and running, and provides just enough functionality for the included samples.

    This interface may be used directly for simple applications and testing. However, for anything more advanced we recommend to use the backend as a
    starting point and copy relevant parts into the main loop of your application. On the other hand, the underlying platform and renderer used by the
    backend are intended to be re-usable as is.
